# DMML_FederatedDBSCAN
Project for the <i>'Data Mining and Machine Learning'</i> course. Please, check the [Presentation](Project_Presentation.pdf) for a complete view. 

This is an implementation of a DBSCAN in a federated learning way.

The idea is to train a model, in a "collaborative" way, without transferring the data to a central processing server.

## Steps of the Algorithm

## Benchmarking
The algorithm was tested with various parameter settings and against different data sets. Its performance was then compared with that of a standard DBSCAN. No substantial difference emerged from this comparison.
